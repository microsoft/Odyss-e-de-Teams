# Teams Odyssey

## Introduction

Teams Odyssey is a fun training course designed by Microsoft as a web app. The game is organised by trainers and its mission is to reinforce users’ adoption and use of Microsoft Teams in their organisation.

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148531468-57b99a49-f8db-45e9-a81b-8e73f40b5cd5.png)

Over a season of 4 weeks, answer over 200 questions in 8 topics and 3 different levels of difficulty (only 45 questions available during one week of training). Collect medals and ranking points for your company while learning more about how to use Teams.

The app has an interface for players, a game management interface for the Game Masters and ready-to-use communication tool kit to promote the app. 

- Installation of the application on your Teams tenant
- Configuration of your game environment in Azure, set-up for the Game Master and game activation for all targets users
- Launch of a Teams Odyssey season.

#### Benefits

Once the app is installed on your organisation’s tenant, users can begin the adventure by simply clicking on the application icon. No installation or login is required or requested given that they are already connected to their Teams tenant when they open the application. A disclaimer still has to be accepted to start the game.

Playing Teams Odyssey means discovering and learning good uses and best practices for Microsoft Teams in a fun way.

#### Cost

The Teams Odyssey app is free. Simply download the package to access the game folders and installation guide. The app does, however, require subscription to Azure, which must be paid for.

#### Prerequisites

The following is required to install and configure the Teams Odyssey application:
- An Azure tenant (and an active subscription) and an administrator.
- A database administrator (PostgreSQL) to create and build the game database (which will be hosted on Azure for the duration of the game).
- A Teams Administrator to install the application on your tenant and make it available
- Access to the Microsoft Teams Admin dashboard with the rights required for importing an application and managing policies (access allocation rules for an application).
- Access to your Microsoft Azure platform to create a game environment and allocate the Game Master roles.
- Ask the following questions and collect the answers.
   - Is this game for all employees of the Microsoft Teams tenant or only a specific group?
   - Which people will be the Game Masters for the coming season? We highly recommend getting the work email addresses for at least two Game Masters. This can be a backup if any of the Game Masters are unavailable. Note: a Game Master will have access to a different interface than the players and will not be able to play the game (answer questions, collect points and medals, etc.).
   - Teams Odyssey is designed as a 4-week campaign. Setting the right date for launching the Teams Odyssey season is highly recommended. We recommend starting the game on a Monday and avoiding any holiday seasons or busy times.

# Installing Teams Odyssey on your Teams tenant

## Introduction

Teams Odyssey is a web application. The zip package &quot;_LOdysseedeTeams2021.zip_&quot; must be downloaded from GitHub then imported to your organisation&#39;s Microsoft Teams store. This requires specific access rights to the Microsoft Teams Admin dashboard. If your organisation has deactivated the Microsoft Teams store, you will find a reactivation link below to install the application.

[https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps)

Note: There is no specific port to open for the installation.

### A firewall is blocking the installation

If a firewall or proxy is blocking the installation process, the link below will add a policy to your Teams tenant authorising calls to this URL.

# First steps to activate Teams Odyssey - The role of the Game Master

## Introduction

Now that the Teams Odyssey application is correctly installed on your Microsoft Teams tenant, your game environment has been created on Azure and the Game Masters have been configured, final activation is required.

Here the role of the Game Master is necessary. If the game has not been activated by the Game Master, the Explorers (players) will not be able to access their interface.

## Becoming a Game Master and configuring a season

The Game Master&#39;s role is to manage a 4-week season during which the Explorers will answer over 200 questions. The Game Master has a specific interface which allows them to:

- Install their organisation&#39;s logo using the &quot;Tool&quot; tab;
- Stop the game using the &quot;Tool&quot; tab;
- Activate the modules of 45 single questions every week using the &quot;Scheduling&quot; tab;
- Access game statistics and rankings in real-time using the &quot;Rankings&quot; tab;

An illustrated &quot;Gamemaster.pdf&quot; file is available in the &quot;GameMasterkit.zip&quot; package to help the Game Master learn how to use their interface.

The Game Master can also be responsible for promoting the game in the organisation before and throughout the season. An out-of-the-box communication tool kit is provided: &quot;Communication – Kit\_assets.zip&quot;. We highly recommend:

- Personalising emails with the Teams Odyssey identity available in the &quot;Scheduling&quot; tab before the launch (teaser) and at regular intervals throughout the event. Emails cannot be sent directly from the platform. You will have to copy/paste them and send them through your regular email system;
- Advertise the game to your organisation through internal channels like Yammer, Teams, Outlook and other intranets;
- Send Teams notifications through the &quot;Push notification&quot; feature using the &quot;Scheduling&quot; tab. You can write whatever you like in a notification but no more than 32 characters. The notification received by users will provide automatic access to the game with a simple click.

Note: It is not possible to extract player rankings. We recommend the Game Master do a screenshot of the rankings as the game progresses.

## First login

1. Go to your Microsoft Teams interface. Click on the Teams Odyssey icon on the side bar, if it was pinned there during installation.

![78](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148473900-22dfa960-2275-4ae4-9f69-4dba7c6cb73d.png)

2. If not, go to your app store and search for &quot;Teams Odyssey&quot;.

![79](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148473922-8e7447d3-b694-444e-a45e-652ad7e31061.png)

3. Click &quot;Open&quot; to launch the application.

4. You will land on the first page of the game. Click on &quot;Play now!&quot; to continue.

![81](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148475620-d5bbd54b-dfc1-4599-8424-6e6c9f34daa3.png)

5. On the next page, read the GDPR, tick the box &quot;I have read the terms and conditions of the game&quot; and click &quot;Confirm and continue!&quot; to continue in the game.

![82](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148475639-72ea561e-2dfa-491b-8730-b49e52874072.png)

6. On the page where you select your spaceship (your avatar in the game), choose one of the images and click on &quot;Complete settings&quot;. Your choice of spaceship will not affect your experience.

![83](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148475661-e607b08e-17aa-46fa-a535-2687cba3ccc2.png)

7. You will then arrive at the main tab of your interface: the cockpit. From this moment, the game is activated and accessible for all Explorers.

![84](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148475687-12e9d21a-b294-471d-8b09-3d4632909400.png)

The &quot;Cockpit&quot; tab is your landing dashboard when you open the game. The &quot;Scheduling&quot; tab is where you activate all the missions. You will find email and social media templates there and you can send push notifications from there too. The &quot;Rankings&quot; tab is where you can check game statistics in real-time and the rankings within your organisation. Finally, in the &quot;Tools&quot; tab you can configure the logo of your organisation and stop the game at any time with the &quot;stop the game&quot; function.

## Activating the first question module

You now have access to the Game Master interface and the Explorers now have access to the game. However, if none of the question modules are activated, the players cannot play the game.

When you want to officially launch the first week in your organisation&#39;s Teams Odyssey season, follow these steps:

8. Go to the &quot;Scheduling&quot; tab in your interface.
9. Open the &quot;Program and missions&quot; tab.

![85](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148475714-fc58061c-a386-4ad4-83a3-d192b4b66f20.png)

10. To activate the first question module, click the &quot;Pending mission&quot; button. The order of the modules is as follows:

  - &quot;Launch! &quot;
  - &quot;Stabilisation! &quot;
  - &quot;Progress! &quot;
  - &quot;Touchdown! &quot;

Note that when a Game Master activates a new week, this deactivates the previous week. It is not possible to have two weeks activated at the same time. To avoid confusing the rankings, it is not possible for players to go back to a previous week&#39;s questions. It is therefore important to remind them to keep up with the game.

## Stopping or pausing the game

11. If you would like to pause or stop the game, go to the &quot;Tools&quot; tab.
12. Click &quot;Block access to the game&quot; to pause or stop the game. To reactivate the game, select one of the question modules in the &quot;Scheduling&quot; tab as explained above.

![86](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57418005/148475773-6c58521e-30cc-410f-8983-fee5cbb79ce9.png)

13. At the end of the season, if you would like to keep track of the rankings, we recommend taking screenshots because you will not be able to extract this information from the application.

## Game Master guide - Further information

All the information specific to the role of Game Master is available in the document &quot;Teams\_Odyssey - Game\_Master\_Guide.pdf&quot; provided with the game.

**Congratulations! The Teams Odyssey season is now up and running!**
